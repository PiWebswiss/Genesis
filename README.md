# AI Model to classify surgical instruments

## Introduction 

The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately recognize surgical instruments from their images.

## The dataset 
The dataset is composed of frames captured from videos of surgical instruments and separate images found on the internet.

You can view a demonstration of the model on my website here. [Try it](https://piweb.ch/recognise%20surgical%20instruments/)
