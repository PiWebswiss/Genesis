# MedAI: Surgical Instrument Recognition with AI

## Project Description

MedAI aims to automate surgical instrument recognition using a camera and an AI model. 


## Objectives

1. Create a dataset of surgical instrument images.
2. Develop a machine learning model for instrument classification.
3. Deploy the model for production use.


## Project Benefits
- Automate tasks
- Improved efficiency 
- Reduced human errors


## Project Limitations

- Achieving 100% accuracy is challenging.
- The model's initial capabilities will be limited to instruments in the training dataset.
- Performance may be affected by image quality, lighting, and irrelevant images.
- The model may need updates for new instruments or different environments.


## Project Stages
- I made a demo where you can use the model to recognize 5 different surgical instruments[here](https://piweb.ch/recognise-surgical-instruments/).
- I've trained several models in TensorFlow, PyTorch, and YOLOv5. For more info, check my code 

<!-- __The Project is still in R&D phase.__

### To Do list

## Data Collection:
- [ ] ``dataset_builder.py``: (Code to gather, process, and organize images)
- [ ] Instruments to be recognized should be listed.
- [ ] Collected the from videos, online sources, etc.
- [ ] Cleaned and organized the dataset.
- [ ] Make sure Images should be evenly distributed among categories.


## Model Training
- [ ] ``train_model.py``: (Code to define, train, and evaluate your model)
- [ ] The best configuration (ML, DL, LLM, etc.) should be chosen.
- [ ] The model should be configured and trained.
- [ ] The model should be evaluated on unseen data.
- [ ] Necessary modifications should be made to improve accuracy.
- [ ] A final evaluation should be conducted before the testing phase.


### Beta Testing
- [ ] ``webTest.py``: (testing the model using a web app) 
- [ ] The model should be configured for real-world testing using a web application.
    - [ ] Overall model accuracy should be evaluated.
    - [ ] Overall model ability to identify instruments correctly should be evaluated.
- [ ] It should be determined whatever the model is ready for the production phase (alpha test).

## Production Preparation
- [ ] install the model for production
