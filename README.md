# MedAI: Surgical Instrument Recognition with AI

## Project Description

MedAI aims to automate surgical instrument recognition using a camera and an AI model. 


## Objectives

1. Create a dataset of surgical instrument images.
2. Develop a machine learning model for instrument classification.
3. Deploy the model for production use.


## Project Benefits

Improved efficiency in the operating room
Reduced human errors
Enhanced patient Safety
Project Limitations

Achieving 100% accuracy is challenging.
The model's initial capabilities will be limited to instruments in the training dataset.
Performance may be affected by image quality, lighting, and irrelevant images.
The model may need updates for new instruments or different environments.
Project Stages


### To Do list

## Data Collection:
[] ``dataset_builder.py``: (Code to gather, process, and organize images)
[] Instruments to be recognized should be listed.
[] Collected the from videos, online sources, etc.
[] Cleaned and organized the dataset.
[] Make sure Images should be evenly distributed among categories.


## Model Training
[] model_trainer.py: (Code to define, train, and evaluate your model)
[] The best configuration (ML, DL, LLM, etc.) should be chosen.
[] The model should be configured and trained.
[] The model should be evaluated on unseen data.
[] Necessary modifications should be made to improve accuracy.
[] A final evaluation should be conducted before the testing phase.


### Beta Testing
[] inference.py: (Code for applying the model to new images)
Production Preparation
[] The model should be configured for real-world testing using a web application.
[] The model's accuracy should be evaluated.
[] The model's ability to identify instruments should be determined.
[] The model's real-world accuracy percentage should be determined.
[] It should be determined whether the model is ready for the production phase (alpha test).

## Production Preparation
[] install the model for production
