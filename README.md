# MedAI: Surgical Instrument Recognition with AI

## Project Description

MedAI aims to automate surgical instrument recognition using a camera and an AI model. 


## Objectives

1. Create a dataset of surgical instrument images.
2. Develop a machine learning model for instrument classification.
3. Deploy the model for production use.


## Project Benefits
- Automate tasks
- Improved efficiency 
- Reduced human errors


## Project Limitations

- Achieving 100% accuracy is challenging.
- The model's initial capabilities will be limited to instruments in the training dataset.
- Performance may be affected by image quality, lighting, and irrelevant images.
- The model may need updates for new instruments or different environments.


## Project Stages
- I made a demo where you can use the model to recognize 5 different surgical instruments [here](https://piweb.ch/recognise-surgical-instruments/).
- I've trained several models in TensorFlow, PyTorch, and YOLOv5. For more info, check my code.
